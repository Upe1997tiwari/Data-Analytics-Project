Netflix Movie Data Analysis Project

Netflix is a leader in using data science, machine learning, and AI to enhance user experience and content delivery. In this project, we analyze a dataset of over 9,000 Netflix movies to uncover key insights that can drive business decisions and optimize content strategy.

##Objectives:

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer critical business questions:

What is the most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix?
Identifying popular genres helps understand audience preferences.

Which movie has the highest average vote (vote_avg)?
This highlights critically acclaimed content.

Which movie has the highest popularity score? What’s its genre?
Helps determine top-performing content based on viewership metrics.

Which movie has the lowest popularity score? What’s its genre?
Useful for identifying underperforming content and possible gaps.

Which year had the most movies released on Netflix?
Tracks content production trends over the years.
